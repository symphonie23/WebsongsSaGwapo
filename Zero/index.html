<p>Ahead in the empty distance
<br>Fading away unanswered
<br>I turn off the lights
<br>To see all the colors in the shadow
<br>Travels across an instant
<br>Far beyond tomorrow
<br>I'm watching a faint breath
<br>Send a ripple through the water

<p>When I lose myself
<br>I become you
<br>Ichi kara juu leads me back to
<br>Here inside your veil
<br>Finer than a grand view
<br>We'll take a dive
<br>Not even tides can come between us

<p>Was it you who I've been searching for
<br>Spent my life alone and waited for?
<br>So tenderly and endlessly
<br>You made me whole, you made me whole
<br>And the walls I built they melt away
<br>With every touch in your embrace
<br>Every day, every night, every note I play
<br>You made me whole, you made me whole

<p>How could I have been so blinded
<br>Running away in circles
<br>I hear my doubts drop
<br>When I see you in the mirror
<br>Right beneath the surface
<br>Washed away my sorrows
<br>I feel your heartbeat
<br>As it echoes through the hour

<p>When I lose myself
<br>I become you
<br>You are the moment I belong to
<br>Here without our names
<br>We're back to being brand new
<br>There's no need to hide
<br>Just you and I until forever

<p>Was it you who I've been searching for
<br>Spent my life alone and waited for?
<br>So tenderly and endlessly
<br>You made me whole, you made me whole
<br>Was it you who I heard through the door
<br>When I cried and had no place to go?
<br>Every day, every night, every note I play
<br>You made me whole, you made me whole

<p>Tracing and tracing the sunset
<br>Appearing a zero and finally
<br>Now I remember
<br>I have never lived a day without you
<br>Untie the layer of memories
<br>Louder we spin with the melody
<br>You are the only, only one for me

<p>Was it you who I've been searching for
<br>Spent my life alone and waited for?
<br>So tenderly and endlessly
<br>You made me whole, you made me whole
<br>And the walls I built they melt away
<br>With every touch in your embrace
<br>Every day, every night, every note I play
<br>You made me whole, you made me whole
<br>Was it you who I heard through the door
<br>When I cried and had no place to go?
<br>Meguri meguru toki no naka
<br>I'll never believe I'm alone
<br>In the end we begin 'til we meet again
<br>You made me whole, you made me whole

<p>I lose myself
<br>I lose myself
<br>I lose myself
<br>I lose myself
<p>I know I'm never alone
